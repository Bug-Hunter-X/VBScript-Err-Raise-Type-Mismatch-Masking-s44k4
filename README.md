This repository demonstrates a potential issue with error handling in VBScript. The `bug.vbs` file shows a function that uses `Err.Raise 13` to handle empty parameters. While seemingly straightforward, this approach might mask other, more subtle, type mismatch issues. The `bugSolution.vbs` offers an alternative handling approach to improve error reporting and prevent potential misdiagnoses.
